###### ^Issue resolved by fixing the case sensitive filename for jpg files in the compiled css version.



## What I learned:
I felt the need to brush up on writing HTML and CSS, so I created a photo gallery that is an extension for my professional profile at http://brianlam.info/ 

The main goal was to learn the basis of how the PHP Laravel framework work for developing small/medium sized applications. From this experience, I really enjoy working with this framework and plan to develop more web application with this. 


## Tools used:
### Laravel Framework
### HTML/CSS/SASS
### PHP
### Blade Templates
### WebPack
